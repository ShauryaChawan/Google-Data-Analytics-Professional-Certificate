## Five Key Aspects of Analytical Thinking

### Visualization

- <b>Definition:</b> Graphical representation of information (e.g., graphs, maps).
- <b>Importance:</b> Enhances understanding and communication of data.
- <b>Example:</b> Explaining the Grand Canyon through visuals instead of just words.

### Strategy
- <b>Definition:</b> Having a clear plan for achieving goals with data and collecting valuable information.
- <b>Importance:</b> Helps in navigating vast amounts of data effectively.
- <b>Example:</b>  Strategizing data collection for the warehouse inventory problem.

### Problem-Orientation
- <b>Definition:</b> Identifying, describing, and solving problems.
- <b>Importance:</b> Maintains focus on the primary goal throughout a project.
- <b>Example:</b> 
  - Addressing the problem of a warehouse constantly running out of supplies.
  - Strategizing how to collect data to solve a warehouse inventory problem.

### Correlation
- <b>Definition:</b> Identifying relationships between two or more pieces of data.
- <b>Importance:</b> Allows for better insights but does not imply causation.
- <b>Important Note:</b> Correlation does not equal causation (just because two things change together, doesn't mean one causes the other).
- <b>Example:</b> Rainy season and umbrella sales might be correlated, but rain doesn't cause people to buy umbrellas.

### Big-Picture and Detail-Oriented Thinking
- <b>Big-Picture Thinking:</b>

	- <b>Definition:</b> Seeing both the overall picture and possibilities.
	- <b>Importance:</b> Encourages innovation and the generation of new ideas.
	- <b>Example:</b> Comparing big-picture thinking to viewing a complete jigsaw puzzle.

- <b>Detail-Oriented Thinking:</b>

	- <b>Definition:</b> Focusing on individual aspects to execute a plan.
	- <b>Importance:</b> Ensures thorough understanding and execution of tasks.
	- <b>Example:</b> Recognizing the importance of each puzzle piece in solving a problem.
