## Data Analysis Process

Refer to the doc [Data Analysis Process](/1.%20Foundation%20-%20Data%20Everywhere/Week%201/4.%20Data%20Analytics%20Certificate%20Roadmap.md)

The 6 Stages of the Data Analysis Process
### Ask:
- <b>Objective:</b> Define the problem or question that needs addressing through data analysis.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
  - Clearly articulate the problem or question.
  - Understand the scope and objectives of the analysis.
  - Identify the data needed to answer the question.

### Prepare:
- <b>Objective:</b> Organize and clean the collected data to make it suitable for analysis.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
  - <b>Data collection:</b> Gather relevant data from various sources.
  - <b>Data cleaning:</b> Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
  - <b>Data organization:</b> Structure data in a format conducive to analysis.

### Process:
- <b>Objective:</b> Transform and manipulate the data to derive meaningful insights.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
  - <b>Data transformation:</b> Convert raw data into a usable format.
  - <b>Data integration:</b> Combine data from different sources if necessary.
  - <b>Data reduction:</b> Focus on relevant variables and reduce unnecessary complexity.

### Analyze:
- <b>Objective:</b> Uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the processed data.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
  - <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b> Visualize data and identify patterns.
  - <b>Statistical analysis:</b> Apply statistical methods to derive insights.
  - <b>Machine learning:</b> Implement algorithms to make predictions or classifications.

### Share:
- <b>Objective:</b> Communicate findings and insights to relevant stakeholders.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
  - <b>Develop visualizations:</b> Present data insights using charts, graphs, and reports.
  - <b>Create a narrative:</b> Explain the significance of findings in a clear and understandable manner.
  - Share results with team members, decision-makers, or clients.

### Act:
- <b>Objective:</b> Take informed actions based on the analysis to address the initial problem or question.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
  - <b>Decision-making:</b> Use insights to make informed decisions.
  - <b>Implementation:</b> Execute changes or strategies based on analysis results.
  - <b>Continuous improvement:</b> Iterate the process based on feedback and new data.

<b>NOTE:</b> The data analysis process is iterative, and feedback from each stage may lead to revisiting previous stages for refinement and improvement. The goal is to create a continuous cycle of learning and improvement in decision-making based on data-driven insights.

## Data Life Cycle

The 6 Stages of the Data Life Cycle

### Plan:
- <b>Objective:</b> Establish the purpose, scope, and objectives of data usage.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
  - Define data requirements and goals.	
  - Develop data management policies and procedures.
  - Establish security and privacy considerations.
  - Plan for compliance with relevant regulations.

### Capture:
- <b>Objective:</b> Acquire and collect data from various sources.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
  - <b>Data collection:</b> Gather information from internal and external sources.
  - <b>Data entry:</b> Input data into systems or databases.
  - <b>Data ingestion:</b> Bring in data from different formats and structures.

### Manage:
- <b>Objective:</b> Organize, store, and maintain data efficiently and securely.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
	- <b>Data storage:</b> Choose appropriate storage solutions (databases, cloud storage).
	- <b>Data organization:</b> Categorize and structure data for easy retrieval.
	- <b>Data quality assurance:</b> Ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency.
Implement access controls to safeguard sensitive information.

### Analyze:
- <b>Objective:</b> Examine and derive insights from the data to inform decision-making.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
	- <b>Data processing:</b> Transform raw data into a usable format for analysis.
	- <b>Data exploration:</b> Use various techniques to uncover patterns and trends.
	- <b>Statistical analysis:</b> Apply statistical methods or machine learning algorithms.
Generate reports and visualizations to communicate findings.

### Archive:
- <b>Objective:</b> Preserve and store data for long-term retention or compliance.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
  - Identify data that requires archiving based on regulatory or business needs.
  - Implement archival procedures, including data backup and storage.
  - Ensure data integrity and security during the archival process.

### Destroy:
- <b>Objective:</b> Securely and permanently eliminate data that is no longer needed.
- <b>Key Activities:</b>
  - Identify data that has reached the end of its life cycle.
  - Implement data destruction methods in compliance with regulations.
  - Document and verify the destruction process for audit purposes.

<b>NOTE:</b> The Data Life Cycle is a continuous process, and each stage influences the others. Proper management at each stage ensures data integrity, security, and compliance throughout its life cycle. Additionally, adherence to data privacy regulations is crucial, especially during the archive and destroy stages.
